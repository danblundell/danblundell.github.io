There's been an ever increasing problem in development that has made me shy away from it for such a long time.

Technology changes so quickly, it's a constant battle trying to keep up. More frustratingly I found that I was spending more and more time fighting with installing things on my laptop, only to switch projects and find that I needed a different version of that thing to make that project work. It became ridiculous.

We've tried to keep up but the biggest problem is increasing the time-to-productive. The time it takes from bringing a new developer into your team to them making valuble contributions to your project.

I _think_, Docker may help here.

Docker is containers. Containers aren't actually that new but there's certainly been leaps and boounds of improvment to make better use of them to turn a concept into an ecosystem.

Docker is <blah>. A bit like virtual machines but typically much less resource intensive.

Typically we get a situation where a developer joins a new team only to find they've already started the code. Almost always, there's some dependencies, libraries of code and software that need to be installed on your laptop so that the code will run. Even if you have the right software installed, doesn't mean the code will run though.

It potentially improves how quckly a developer can be productive because the only dependency a developer needs, is Docker.
