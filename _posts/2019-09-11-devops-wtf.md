OPENING TO BE WRITTEN

> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity
<cite>&mdash; [Amazon Web Services][aws-blog]</cite>

It's important because speed is critical and change is now our state of normal. So to avoid moving fast and breaking things (cheers [Mark][mark] ðŸ¤®), we need ways to move fast, safely. Sure we can change tools and adopt some small changes to improve the way we work but DevOps as a culture is proven to be a pretty good way of making sure you're continuous improving and continuously learning, safely.

I'm not saying we don't break things, we do, what I'm saying is, we're building a culture of designing things to fail safely, gracefully and informatively so that we can recover services quickly and continously improve. That, to me at least, is what DevOps is about.

## How we started



## What didn't work



## What we're doing next

Now we're at a point where we've experimented with a few concepts and have found ways to build them into our daily work, our next step is scaling out whilst sticking to our principles of contiously learning and experimentation.
