1. Who's pockets do you want to line?

2. Need a team anyway no matter whaht you do

3. Creativity comes from people, shared problems and experiences

4. More resiliience and skills vs big investment with technology vendors

Reasons building teams is hard
- recruitment?
- risk?
- experience / where to start?
