Week commencing 2nd September 2019.

## Focus for the week
This week started pretty slowly after a traumatic weekend in hospital with my wife, running around to try and keep her and my son safe and cared for I didn't start Monday feeling that great. Thankfully we were all home safe and sound but a little less than rested. 

Monday was mostly admin just to keep my head in the game and ease myself into the week. I spent the evening building a quick performance dashboard in [Vue.js][vuejs], if that's your thing, we're publishing progress on the [LGSS GitHub account][github-lgss] under our [Vue Dashboard][vue-dashboard] project and thanks to the wondeful world of version control, you can see the _exact_ work I did this week [here][vue-dashboard-pr]. üöÄ

Tuesday was great. I had an early call with one of our apprentices, Anthony. He's working on automating our performance data[^1], building a series of small but perfectly formed integrations to automatically get data out of the different tools we use. This way, we're building reporting into our daily work, we don't have to spend time generating reports, the tools will do it all for us. Anthony's already built automated reporting for Availability and 'Prospect to projects', the number of proposals that we successfully take on and deliver. He's even published the work as [SLA_Dashboard_APIs][sla-apis] on the [LGSS Github][github-lgss]. Thanks to Anthony and people like Anthony, we're another step closer to making our work more visible, open and more understandable for all.

Wednesday kicked off with a leadership team meeting over at Vantage House in Huntingdon, fyi, parking there is _awful_. I worked on the [dashboard][vue-dashboard] in Costa for a bit before the meeting and then we talked about our team, approach, recruitment, support and our priorities for improvement which to be honest, were all a bit of a blur.

After the meeting, I headed off to collect a [Deep Lens camera][deep-lens] from AWS[^2]. The Deep Lens camera is "deep learning-enabled video camera for developers" whcih apparently "allows developers to get started with deep learning with a single click."

I've got some time aside to put it to work next week, all being well it should recognise my face and spam everyone in the office whenever I walk in or out...like the narcissitic crazy person that I am not.

> AWS DeepLens allows developers to get started with deep learning through sample projects with practical, hands-on examples which can start running with a single click.

To round off Wednesday I had another impromptu catch up with [Lauren][redjotter] which is always an absolute pleasure, we talked family, design, opportunity, leadership and business strategies.

Finally to finish up the week I had two meetings about contracts and facilitated two other meetings; one to improve our DevOps skills and another for service improvements to some HR'y finance things. After all that, our whole team headed to the Milton Keynes office to say goodbye and thank you to Ratesh (a self confessed car-nut) who left us for an absolute dream job of his (at Mercedes).

Thanks Ratesh, you've done incredible work with impact.

## What I‚Äôm thinking about


## I am pleased
* My family are still in one piece
* We got to say goodbye to Ratesh as a team, despite the difficult and often silent challenges people are facing
* I have a [new toy][deep-lens] to play with
* This week is over. It was tough to say the least.

## Recommendations
* [Set Free][simon-standup] ‚Äì the latest instalment from [Simon Amstell][simon-standup] is on [Netflix][netflix]. Beyond it's obvious hilarity, it's vulnerable, witty and deeply honest üìΩÔ∏è
* [New Adventures Conference][naconf] ‚Äì Is back for another year, it's the conference that kick-started my career, plus I'm quoted on the [Conference page][naconf-quote] because y'know, it's nice to give anything back to an event that gave me so much. I urge you to take a look and if it's _maybe_ your thing, go. You will not regret it.
