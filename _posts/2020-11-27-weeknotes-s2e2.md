Week commencing 23rd November 2020.

This week was an emotional one, our youngest offspring turned one and it stirred up all sorts of post-traumatic reactions for both me and [Vikki][vikki]. I wrote about why in a [separate post][forever-thankful] this week. It's a post that I've had in draft for _months_ and I figured if I can't get it done by his first birthday, it'll never be done. So it got done. I feel so much lighter already.

Reflection and catharsis aside, we made the best of a lockdown birthday for the wee one and I'm sat here at the end of the week feeling very grateful for the compassion and [kind words][forever-thankful-tweet] from so many people, most of which I haven't even met. 

If that's you, I've hopefully said it already but thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

On we go...

## Life
* Our youngest child turned one, we played the drums and ate cake. 🥁 🍰
* I received incredibly kind messages from people about my recent post about youngest child, you can read it [here][forever-thankful]
* I cried about said blog post and aforementioned messages
* We collected the new car 🚗
* Our Christmas tree got delivered, we decorated it, most of the decorations are already back on the floor and vacuuming is a twice-daily ritual (thanks kids) 🎄

## Work
* Worked on NextJS and AzureAD integration for a coaching session in two weeks 👩‍💻
* Marked two weeks left in the current job with some more handover of work to Kiri, Josie and Will 🎉
* Got lost in AWS Billing for way too long - that thing is weird 💰
* Attended the second show and tell for the latest project (websites for the new West and North Northamptonshire unitary authorities) 💻
* Had a few Zoom calls with my soon-to-be team at the [new job][gs]. Loved having new things to think about 🦈

## Side stuff
* Continued to check-in with wonderful folks over at [On The Side][ots] 🫂
* Did some more updates for [Lauren][redjotter] to make the integrations between Circle, Podia and mailing lists work a little smoother. You should sign up for her latest [UPFRONT course][upfront-bond-3] 🟥
* Completed Module 2 of the latest course with [Ness Labs][ness-labs], it's helping me think more consciously about collecting articles and how I do research 👨‍🎓

## Downtime
* More [House][house] we're mid Season 3, I think it's the weird season that included the writers strike... 🩺
* Finished reading [Team Topologies][team-topologies], so many people should read this book 📕 
* Renewed my subscription to [Stratechery][stratechery] and included [Dithering][dithering], I like that the episodes are under 15 minutes long a few times a week as a rarely get longer than that to really concentrate on listening uninterrupted 🌪️
* Enjoyed listening to [Sam][sam] on the [Make It Then Tell Everybody podcast][sam-podcast], you should [check out his work][sam] 🎙️
* Injured my knee, a few days off but still managed to ride 4 days with [Peloton][peloton] this week 🚴‍♂️ (referral code: `PCSC42`)
