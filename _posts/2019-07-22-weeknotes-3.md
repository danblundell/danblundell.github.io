## Monday

First thing, I sent a message around to the team this morning about our all-dayer DevDay on Thursday. It gives people time to understand what to expect, what's expected of them and an opportunity to ask any questions before the day itself.

We have quite a few people in the team who need clarity or time to reflect, being prepped with the details in one go, ahead of time has come to help them be more open and we have way better experiences together so it's something I try and make the effort to consider each time we do anything together now. It's not my default, but it helps others in the team _so_ much, it's definitely worth taking the time to do.
