Week commencing 9th November 2020.

New weeknotes format this week, weeknotes were becoming to labour intensive with less and less value so i'm borrowing a format from [Si][si], who in turn borrowed a format [Brian][brian].

## Life

* Ordered new [LED lighting][govee] for the office because it's now dark most of the time 💡
* Bought a new car 🚗
* Went for a walk in the dark, gave the eldest a torch to go monster hunting 🕵️‍♂️
